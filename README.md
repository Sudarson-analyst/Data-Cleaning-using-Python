## Data Cleaning
When it comes to clean the data python is one of the most efficient language which has the Pandas library in it which was created for data cleaning and data manipulation.I have used different keyword in order to perform the differents functions like removing the duplicates,finding the null values and removing them , replacing some values as per format ,stripping the unwanted character from a series and setting the index after removing the rows.For more details please check the attached python file which has specific action for each statement along with comments for understanding the purpose/function.
